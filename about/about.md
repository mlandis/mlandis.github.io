My name is Michael Landis. I study evolution by developing probabilistic models, writing open source and community-minded software, and analysing simulated and empirical data. My current research interests include phylogenetics, historical biogeography, continuous trait evolution, and Bayesian inference.

In December 2015, I received my PhD in Integrative Biology (with a designated emphasis in Computational and Genomic Biology) under the advisory of [John Huelsenbeck](http://cteg.berkeley.edu/huelsenbeck.html) at UC Berkeley.
There, I studied statistical phylogenetics while developing my interests in historical biogeography and phenotypic evolution.
After graduating, I worked briefly with [Tracy Heath](http://phyloworks.org/) at Iowa State University on problems regarding divergence time estimation and inferring very large phylogenies.
Currently, I am supported by the NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology to research the co-evolution of ecological adaptations and geographical range dynamics, and advised by [Michael Donoghue](http://donoghuelab.yale.edu) at Yale University.

To relax, I hike, read, and cook.

Here's my <a href="/assets/mlandis_cv.pdf">CV</a>.
