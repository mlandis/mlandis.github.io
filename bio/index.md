Hello.

I study evolution by developing probabilistic models, writing open source and community-minded software, and analysing simulated and empirical data. My current research interests include continuous trait evolution, historical biogeography, and population admixture.

To relax, I hike, read, and cook.

Here's my <a href="/assets/mlandis_cv.pdf">CV</a>.
