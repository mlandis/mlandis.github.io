Hello.

I study evolution by developing probabilistic models, writing open source and community-minded software, and analysing simulated and empirical data. My current research interests include phylogenetics, historical biogeography, continuous trait evolution, and Bayesian inference.

To relax, I hike, read, and cook.

Currently, I am a [YIBS Donnelley Fellow](http://yibs.yale.edu/) studying with [Michael Donoghue](http://donoghuelab.yale.edu) at Yale University.

Here's my <a href="/assets/mlandis_cv.pdf">CV</a>.

Site source code is available [here](http://github.com/mlandis/mlandis.github.io). Static site content is generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted using [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).
