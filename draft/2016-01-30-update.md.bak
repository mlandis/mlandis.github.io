Model space is vast.
When models are applied to scientific questions, two forces prune that space into something practical, and ideally, useful.
First, empirical observations 
Second, theory identifies what effects are important or not for the scale of the question at hand.
These first two qualities are positive, in the sense that they establish what parts of model space are worth consideration, and what parts are likely to be irrelevant.
The third constraint on explorable model space, however, is




 
Phylogenetic models, for instance, are dominated by four major components (or [modules](xxx) citation):
the molecular substitution process, the diversification process, the branch-rate variation model (or relaxed clock models), and site-rate variation models.

I am going to write a series of posts describing to conduct a basic phylogenetic analysis in RevByes.
My hope is this will help those new to RevBayes understand its use and design.

There are a few topics to address, each one covered in an individual post over the next few weeks.
I will link to the posts below as they're completed.
