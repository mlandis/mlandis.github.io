# Landis Lab

Our group studies the evolution of life: how has life radiated throughout and adapted to an ever-changing world?
We focus our [research](research) towards macroevolutionary questions in phylogenetics, biogeography, trait evolution, and statistical inference.
To this end, we develop probabilistic models of evolution, write open source and community-minded software to analyze those models, and test evolutionary hypotheses by fitting those models to biological and simulated datasets.

### News

**29 Aug 2018**

I am building a new research group in the [Department of Biology](https://wubio.wustl.edu/) at [Wash U](https://wustl.edu/) in Summer 2019.
That means I'm actively recruiting for PhD and postdoctoral research positions.

New lab members will
* have or seek experience in
  * biology (evolution, genomics, ecology)
  * quantitative (stats, math, CS)
  * programming
* will help design and lead a research project tailored to their background/training goals
* be capable of working collaboratively and independently
* think that most species on the planet are weird
<!-- * will take ownership of a proposed project, depending on the individual's background, strengths, and training goals-->

I will post official advertisements for PhD and postdoctoral research positions by January 2019.
Before then, please [contact](mailto:mlandis@gmail.com) me if you're interested in joining the lab!
