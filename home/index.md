# Modeling Evolution

Our group studies the evolution of life: how has life radiated throughout and adapted to an ever-changing world?
We focus our [research](research) towards macroevolutionary questions in phylogenetics, biogeography, trait evolution, and statistical inference.
To this end, we develop probabilistic models of evolution, write open source and community-minded software to analyze those models, and test evolutionary hypotheses by fitting those models to biological and simulated datasets.

The Landis Lab is hiring!
We are seeking researchers interested in studying evolutionary biology from a quantitative perspective.
New lab members will design statistical models, develop scientific software methods, lead projects, and publish first-author papers.
Postdoctoral and PhD positions are available to start in Summer 2019 (some flexibility).
If interested, please email a brief statement of your research interests and a copy of your CV to [mlandis (at) gmail (dot) com](mailto:mlandis@gmail.com).
A broader invitation to apply will be published by the end of 2018.
