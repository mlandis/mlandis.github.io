Exciting news! I just uploaded the first version of BayArea, a Bayesian method to infer ancestral species ranges using a molecular phylogeny and presence-absence data. The main focus of the method is to accommodate a very large number of discrete areas, constituting a geography over which species' ranges span and may change with time through the gain and loss of area occupancy. BayArea allows the inclusion of hundreds to thousands of areas per analysis, a substantial improvement from the previous limit of ten to twenty areas.

The source code, manual, and an example dataset are available at [http://bayarea.googlecode.com](http://bayarea.googlecode.com). You should expect to see a Systematic Biology paper exposing the technical details soon (written with John Huelsenbeck, Nick Matzke, and Brian Moore). In series of upcoming posts, I'll give a rundown regarding the motivation for the method, the technical challenges faced implementing the software, and what new interesting biological questions BayArea may help answer.
